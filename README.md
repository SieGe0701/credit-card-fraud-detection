# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project uses Python, pandas, scikit-learn, and Flask to build a credit card fraud detection system.

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Store datasets here
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for EDA and prototyping
- `src/`: Source code for preprocessing, training, and API
- `docs/`: Documentation

## Getting Started
1. Place your dataset (e.g., `creditcard.csv`) in the `data/` folder.
2. Use the notebooks for EDA and initial analysis.
3. Run scripts in `src/` for preprocessing and model training.
4. Use the Flask API for predictions.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- Flask
- imbalanced-learn

## Steps
1. Data Exploration & Preprocessing
2. Model Training & Evaluation
3. API Deployment
